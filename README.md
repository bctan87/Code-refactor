# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description 

The goal of this work is to take Horiseon's existing code and refactor it to meet the current web accessibility standards to make it available to a wider variety of audiences 
The current source code of Horiseon's website is a div soup; multiple divs without proper web semantics. This makes it difficult for a web crawler to read their contents, and it also makes it hard for viewers using screen readers.
